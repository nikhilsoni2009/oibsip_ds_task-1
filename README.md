Iris Flower Classification is a machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project demonstrates classification using various algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
